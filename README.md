# Hungry Beta

*Description*: A school of hungry fish waiting to feed with pellet.
- Two additional objects: the pellet and the seaweed aquarium statue.
- Two additional behaviors: attraction/fish swims toward pellet and repulsion/fish repel when hit the statue.

*Artist statement*: I did achieve the simulate a school of fish and the player's interaction with the scene by clicking mouse to drop a pellet.
