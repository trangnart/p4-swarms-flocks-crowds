# Unhungry Beta

*Description*: A school of beta fish that are not bother by foods.

*Artist statement*: I try to make the closest fish eat the green pellet when it drops in the tank. However, I didn't achieve it because the array make it difficult to control the fish's direction. To make my assignment make sense, I change the title name that fit with the situation.
